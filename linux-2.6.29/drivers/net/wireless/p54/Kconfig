config P54_COMMON

	depends on MAC80211 && WLAN_80211 && FW_LOADER && EXPERIMENTAL
	---help---
	  This is common code for isl38xx based cards.
	  This module does nothing by itself - the USB/PCI frontends
	  also need to be enabled in order to support any devices.

	  These devices require softmac firmware which can be found at
	  http://prism54.org/

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called p54common.

	---help---
	  This driver is for PCI isl38xx based wireless cards.

	  supported by the fullmac driver/firmware.

	  This driver requires softmac firmware which can be found at
	  http://prism54.org/

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called p54pci.
